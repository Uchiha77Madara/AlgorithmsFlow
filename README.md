# AlgorithmsFlow

For now this repository only contains a maximum flow algorithm.
It is a good algorithm but implemented in a very naive way.
Running time is very high but since i need it for small graphs, so it doesn't matter to me.

I have tested only on few examples which are given as input*.txt.

# How to Run(Linux)
To compile: g++ maxFlowMPM.cpp\n
To Run: ./a.out input*.txt

Windows user can compile as they like but filename must be passed as command line argument.
